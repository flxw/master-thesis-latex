\chapter*{Abstract}
While manual labor processes have seen a lot of automation in the past,
knowledge-intensive processes are still highly manual.
Assistance systems for knowledge work have been asked for in recent several literature reviews.
Such systems need to anticipate the development of a case in order to offer assitance in the right circumstances.
This capability includes the ability to foresee the next activity in a process.

We connect process prediction to sequence prediction, and adapt a successfully tested word prediction model to predict the next activity in a running process.
We implement two published models as baselines to avoid comparability issues due to data preprocessing.
To make model training easier and increase comparability, we also propose a model training framework.

We evaluate our approaches on seven datasets, and compare them to two recent next-activity prediction approaches on a log from BPIC 2012. On this log, we are able to obtain an accuracy of $0.853$, outperforming the compared approaches by approximately $0.05$.
