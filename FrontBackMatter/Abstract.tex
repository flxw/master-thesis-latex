\chapter*{Abstract}
Manual labor processes have seen a lot of automation in the past, but knowledge-intensive processes still proceed highly manual.
Assistance systems for knowledge work have been asked for in recent several literature reviews.
Such systems need to anticipate the development of a case in order to offer assitance in the right circumstances.
This capability includes the ability to foresee the next activity in a process.
Predicting the next activity in a running process is a young discipline which we aimed to contribute to.

We do so by connecting process prediction to sequence prediction, and adapting a successfully tested word prediction model.
We implement two published models as baselines to avoid comparability issues due to data preprocessing.
To make model training easier and increase comparability, we also propose a model training framework.
Using the framework, we evaluate four models with four preprocessing methods on eight datasets.

Finally, we compare the results to two recent next-activity prediction approaches on a log from BPIC 2012 and on the HelpDesk log.
On the former, we are able to obtain an accuracy of $0.853$, outperforming the compared approaches by approximately $0.07$.
On the latter log, we reach an accuracy of $0.862$.
