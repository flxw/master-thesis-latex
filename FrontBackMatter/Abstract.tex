\chapter*{Abstract}
In this thesis, we compared four different neural network models for their performance in predicting the next activity in a running case. The performance measurement was threefold, based on total accuracy, training time and stability accuracy over the progress of the test traces. The comparison was implemented in Python and Keras and yielded a neural network training framework for Predictive Process Monitoring, which we also presented in this thesis.

The framework not only allows for a trivial execution of numerous model-strategy-dataset combinations but also tackles an issue within current research: comparability. Most publications in Predictive Process Monitoring use different datasets and do not publicize their implementation, thus making comparisons hard. The framework could help researchers get results faster and on more datasets until benchmarking datasets are established.\\
