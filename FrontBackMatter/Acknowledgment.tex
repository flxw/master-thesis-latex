\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
On this page I would like to express my gratitude to the many people who were involved
in the writing of this thesis, and in me getting to the finish line of my master's studies.

I was given a lot of freedom to choose the course of my research and my topic,
and I am happy that I could pursue it this way. My supervisor Luise Pufahl
taught me a lot about the structure and wording of a scientific paper on the way
and Haojin Yang was always there to assist me with technical advice.
Christian Bartz helped me choose a suitable framework.
Stefan Sch√∂nig, and Richard Jasinski provided help in reverse-engineering the models,
and were also helpful in offering advice.
Willi Gierke helped me with some fundamental questions on LSTM.

A big "I owe you one" also goes to everyone to helped proofread this document:
Marvin Bornstein, Stephan Detje, Georg Berecz and Luise Pufahl.

Finally I would like to express my general gratefulness to the following parties:

Stephan Lessmann, for without his \textit{Business Analytics and Data Science} lecture I would not have pursued this topic.

Hasso Plattner, for starting the institute that has made so great of an impact on my life, it could not be summed up on this page.

Finally: my family for being there and giving Geld und gute Worte
