\section{Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion:future-work}
Testing with more data sets

Establishing a process prediction reference data set

Loss of good explanations sequence prediction and especially next-element prediction

Stratification of training and test sets by multiple properties: length and edit-distance of traces
