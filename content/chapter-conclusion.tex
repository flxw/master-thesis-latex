\section{Discussion}
Is the hassle worth it?
Increase in memory, training time...?
Compare with Evermanns etc results

\section{Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion:future-work}
Testing with more data sets

Establishing a process prediction reference data set

Loss of good explanations sequence prediction and especially next-element prediction

Stratification of training and test sets by multiple properties: length and edit-distance of traces

Imbalance of training and target data

\section{Verdict} \label{sec:conclusion:verdict}
