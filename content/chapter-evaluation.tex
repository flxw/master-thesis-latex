\chapter{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}


\section{Implementation}
Model architecture diagrams

Baseline: Evermann
Data: Schönig
SP2/PFS: Shibata on Business processes

Keras, tuning with hyperas, FSOC, Anaconda environment,

one-hot encoding for certain columns since no ordinal relationship present

drop lifecycle:transition
activity code correlates to 
Keras, FSOC, Docker, Anaconda

\section{Data transformation}
Which columns were dropped and why?

\section{Test setup}
Evermann network architecture, Schönig network architecture, my network architecture

Dropping the embedding layer if not embedding is present

\section{Evaluation criteria}
Accuracy and earliness

Does accuracy rise with increasing trace length?

\section{Evaluation results}
Feature Importance score extraction

\section{Result discussion}
Is the hassle worth it?
Increase in memory, training time...?
Compare with Evermanns etc results
